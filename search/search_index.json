Further enhancing its flexibility, the board includes USB-C and USB-A outputs. What's more, we have also included EN and PG pins through which you can control the board using a microcontroller and also attach a switch to the board.</p> <p>The board also includes the following protections:</p> <ol> <li>Over Current Limit (OCL) - Protects the board from overloads by limiting the output current.</li> <li>Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) - When the input voltage on VIN falls below the required voltage, the particular voltage output shuts off.</li> <li>Thermal Shutdown - When any of the buck converter ICs included on the board get too hot, the particular voltage output shuts off.</li> <li>Undervoltage and Overvoltage Protection (UVP &amp; OVP) (Not included for 12V output) - When the output voltage falls too low or goes too high than the desired voltage, the output is discharged and latched.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#setting-it-up","title":"Setting it Up","text":"<p>You must have recieved the following components in your package, when ordering from us:</p> <ol> <li>Spikonado Universal DC Power Module I - x1</li> <li>2.54mm 1x2 Pin Male Header Strip - x3</li> <li>2.54mm 1x2 Pin Female Header Strip - x3</li> <li>2.54mm 1x1 Pin Male Header Strip - x3</li> <li>2.54mm 1x1 Pin Female Header Strip - x3</li> <li>5.0mm 1x2 Pin Screw Terminal Block - x4</li> <li>2.54mm 1x2 Pin Female Jumper - x3</li> </ol> <p>Solder the headers and screw terminals onto your board as you desire.
