# Spikonado Universal DC Power Module I

The [Spikonado Universal DC Power Module I](https://spikonado.com/product/spikonado-universal-dc-power-module-i) is a versatile and high-current buck converter designed to power your most demanding electronics projects. It efficiently (92.7%) converts a wide **13-24** DC input into three stable, dedicated outputs:

- **12V @ 4A**
- **5V @ 10A**
- **3.3V @ 8A**

This module is perfect for robotics, embedded systems, single-board computers (SBCs), custom test jigs, and any application requiring reliable multi-voltage power.<br>
Further enhancing its flexibility, the board includes USB-C and USB-A outputs.<br>
What's more, we have also included EN and PG pins through which you can control the board using a microcontroller and also attach a switch to the board.

The board also includes the following protections:

1. Over Current Limit (OCL) - Protects the board from overloads by limiting the output current.
2. Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) - When the input voltage on VIN falls below the required voltage, the particular voltage output shuts off.
3. Thermal Shutdown - When any of the buck converter ICs included on the board get too hot, the particular voltage output shuts off.
4. Undervoltage and Overvoltage Protection (UVP & OVP) (Not included for 12V output) - When the output voltage falls too low or goes too high than the desired voltage, the output is discharged and latched.
